# Meteor Disaster Miner Deluxe
This game is a follow up on our previous game: Shipsum.
After the player has failed to connect the air supply to the space stations in Shipsum, all crew has died.

It is now many years later and the energy shields of the space stations are no longer up.
 A heavy meteor storm hits the Earth and also takes down the space ships. 
 Your goal as the player is to survive the onslaught of falling debris by digging deeper and staying alive.
